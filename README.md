## General info

Using the Petfinder API, our current application design allows a user to find all animals, including special needs animals, to adopt based on a user's zip code and animal criteria. We also use the google maps API to populate the animal's adoption location on the map based on zip code. 

## User Story

- As a lover of all pets 
- I want people to be able to find a pet companion 
- So that all animals including special needs pets find a loving home.
